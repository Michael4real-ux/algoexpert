## Time Space Complexity

## Recursive

### Time

- where n is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree
- where traversing through every node in the Binary Tree
- we are adding the depth, recursive function calls, pushing, popping values, constant time operations.

### Space

- O(h), is the height of the Binary Tree
- The maximum number of function calls in the callstack
- is going to be the height and depth of the binary tree
- h is the height of the Binary Tree

## Iterative
